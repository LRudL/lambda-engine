# lambda-engine
Lambda calculus interpreter and pretty-printer, plus definitions for a lambda calculus in lambda calculus.

See [here](https://strataoftheworld.blogspot.com/2021/04/lambda-calculus.html) to learn about the lambda calculus and the motivation behind this code.

## Installation & use

- If you don't have it already, get Racket. The simplest way is to download the language+IDE from [here](https://racket-lang.org/).
- Download the files in this repository.
- Use the functions in `main.rkt` to evaluate lambda calculus terms (e.g. `lce`, a simple lambda calculus evaluator that does not print steps and that gives interpretations of terms when it can, instead of displaying the full mess of lambdas).
